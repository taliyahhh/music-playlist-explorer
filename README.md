    - [x] If previously unliked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should increase by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been liked by the user.
    - [x] If previously liked:
      - [x] The like count on the playlist tile should decrease by 1.
      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please film yourself liking and unliking:
      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0
      - [x] a playlist with a non-zero like count

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**
  - [x] Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist's detail modal.
  - [x] When the shuffle button is clicked, the playlist's songs should display in a different order.
  - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself shuffling the same playlist more than once.

      - [x] Duration
  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

[The lab topics prepared me for the assignment, but I'd say that it was the lab topics I was not necessarily prepared for. I have experience with JavaScript, but obviously it is a fast-paced curriculum. After reaching out to peers and instructors, and taking style inspiration from UI on other websites, I was able to understand JS better!]

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
[If given more time, I would first allow the user to add playlists, since they are already able to remove a playlist from the grid view. Additionally, I would create a more cohesive color scheme and theme across all pages and popups. Finally, I would embed the Spotify codes of songs mentioned, so that the user has an option to play said songs within the Playlist Explorer site.]

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

[My project demo went as expected, though I am going to aim for 2-3 stretch features on the remaining projects. My peers were able to effectively implement aesthetically plesing search bars with functionality, which I am hoping to master for the incoming project 3.]

### Shout out

[Shout to Josh (peer) for helping me with the functionality of the shuffle feature. Also, shoutout Devarsh and Lucia for giving feedback on the UI design, and helping me develop mock data.json code to test site feasibility (data later changed to songs I actually listen to).]
